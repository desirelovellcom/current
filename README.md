# 🌐 Current – Decentralized Kindness Messaging

> “Your Conversation Your Data Your Freedom Your CALL ☎️📲📞.” – #desirelovell

**Current** is a peer-to-peer, encrypted messaging app that works entirely over **Bluetooth mesh** and **WiFi Direct**, with **no servers, no phone numbers, no accounts, and no tracking**.

All messages are **ephemeral**, **end-to-end encrypted**, and **stored only on your device**. It’s real, it’s live, and it’s available now on the App Store and Google Play.

## 🔒 Privacy by Design  
- No phone numbers, usernames, or email required  
- Messages never leave your device — **no cloud**  
- End-to-end encryption using session-based ephemeral keys  
- Entirely **offline-capable** using Bluetooth mesh and WiFi Direct

## 🎨 UI Inspired by #desirelovell  
- **Dark mode UI** with **gradient pastels** “Kindness Mode”

## 💗 Kindness Mode  
When activated, “Kindness Mode” enables:
- Animated glows for uplifting messages  
- Anonymous “Light” tokens to reward encouragement  
- “#desirelovell” tag stream to spotlight kindness in the mesh

## 🧬 Vision
Current was inspired by early prototypes of decentralized messaging apps — reimagined for beauty, privacy, and empathy.

Jack Dorsey #visionary 👩🏽‍💻 the conceptual 🦋. **#desirelovell** gave it color, kindness, and soul.

> This isn’t just messaging. It’s a movement to reconnect locally, without middlemen.
